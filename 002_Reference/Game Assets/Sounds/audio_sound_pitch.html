<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
This function can be used to change the pitch of a given sound. The sound can either be one referenced from an index for an individual sound being played which has been stored in a variable when using the 
<a href="audio_play_sound.html"><tt>audio_play_sound</tt></a> or <a href="audio_play_sound_at.html"><tt>audio_play_sound_at</tt></a> functions, or an actual sound asset from the resource tree. 
If it is an index of a playing sound, then only that instance will be changed, however when using a sound asset from the resource tree, all further instances being played of that sound will be changed.
<br>
<br>

The pitch argument is a <i>pitch multiplier</i>, in that the input value multiplies the current pitch by that amount, so the default value of 1 is no pitch change, while a value of less than 1 will lower the pitch 
and greater than 1 will raise the pitch. It is best to use small increments for this function as any value under 0 or over 5 may not be audible anyway. It is worth noting that the total pitch change permitted is 
clamped to (1/256) - 256 octaves, so any value over or under this will not be registered.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>The clamped value given above is what <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> attempts to clamp the range to, but this value is <b>not</b> guaranteed on all target platforms. iOS, for example, 
clamps to (1/256) - 8, so you may need to experiment on each target platform and have different versions of a sound resource, each one pre-shifted, should you require higher or lower octave values.</i>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
var s_engine = audio_play_sound(snd_CarEngine, 10, false);<br>
switch (gear)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 1: audio_sound_pitch(s_engine, 0.8); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 2: audio_sound_pitch(s_engine, 0.9); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 3: audio_sound_pitch(s_engine, 0.95); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 4: audio_sound_pitch(s_engine, 1); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 5: audio_sound_pitch(s_engine, 1.2); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will change the pitch of the audio played from the sound indexed in the variable "s_engine" based on the value of the variable "gear".
