<h1 class="studio">fps_real</h1>
  
<h2 class="studio">Returns the real frames per second.</h2>

<h3 class="studio">Syntax:</h3>
<p class="code">fps_real</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns: </b>Real
</p>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
In <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> there are two main ways that can be used to tell the speed at which your game runs. The <a href="../Rooms/room_speed.html"><tt>room_speed</tt></a> (as specified in 
the room editor) and the <tt>fps</tt> (frames per second). These values are often confused, but basically one is the number of game steps that <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> is supposed to be completing in a 
second (room speed), while the other is the number of CPU steps that GameMaker: Studio is actually completing in a second (the real fps), and this value is generally much higher than the room speed, but 
will drop as your game gets more complex and uses more processing power to maintain the set room speed.
<br>
<br>

This <b>read-only</b> variable returns the current fps as an integer value. Please note that the function will only update once every step of your game and so may appear to "jump" from one value to another, 
but this is quite normal.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
if debug_mode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_text(32, 32, "FPS = " + string(fps_real));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will check to see if the game is in debug mode and if it is it will display the current real fps on the screen.
