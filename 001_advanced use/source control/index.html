<h1 class="studio">Source Control Management</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> incorporates a complete source control management system, ready to use with any one of the SCM packages available.</h2>

<p>
<b>Source Control Management (SCM)</b> is the name given to the method of working with <i>sub-versions</i> or backups of your projects through a repository and local source. Basically, an SCM solution is an 
independent software package which controls all the aspects of maintaining, changing and comparing versions of your project as you work on it. This is especially useful to those that work in a team and need to be 
able to control who does what and not worry about losing data or making changes that may need to be undone at a later date, but individuals can benefit from this powerful yet flexible system too.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">We recommend that you have some working knowledge of how source control works before attempting to use it in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i></font></b>.<br>
<p>

There are various SCM tools available to you, and <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> permits you to use the three most popular:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">SVN</a>
		<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT</a>
		<li><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial</a>
	</ul>
<p>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>You can use other SCM solutions, but these are the ones that GameMaker has tutorials and default configurations for. Other tools will require you to set up custom profiles, which are explained 
briefly on the page <a href="../../001_advanced%20use/preferences/source%20control%20preferences.html">Source Control Preferences</a>.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you are not too familiar with SCM solutions then we recommend you use SVN and install a user-interface like <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a>. <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> comes 
bundled with the 1.7 and 1.8 versions of SVN by default, so if you use this option make sure that the user-interface you use is for the either of the those versions (preferably the 1.8 version). Both GIT and Mercurial are 
advanced SCM solutions and require that you have a good working knowledge of how SCM works, and prior experience with both is a benefit if possible.
<br>
<br>

It is important to note that we recommend that you change the following <b>Preferences</b> before continuing to activate SCM in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>:

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../preferences/general%20preferences.html">General</a> - Automatically increase build number
		<li><a href="../preferences/form%20preferences.html">Forms</a> - When closing, remove instances outside the room
		<li><a href="../preferences/form%20preferences.html">Forms</a> - Remember room settings when closing the form
	</ul>
</blockquote>
