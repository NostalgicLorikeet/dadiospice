<h1 class="studio">The Draw Event</h1>

<h2 class="studio">The Draw Events are some of the many events that can be triggered in an instance and may contain code or actions.</h2>

<p>

<br>

This event is the one that governs what you see on the screen when you run your game, and is split into various separate "sub-events":

As you can see, the draw event category has multiple different event types, and here we will deal with the standard Draw Events: draw Begin, Draw and Draw End. You can get information on the other event types from 
the following pages:

<p>
The standard draw events are the ones covered on this page and they run <i>before</i> the <b>Draw GUI</b> events and </i>between</i> the <b>Pre Draw</b> and <b>Post Draw</b> events, meaning 
that everything that is drawn in this event is drawn beneath that of the Draw GUI event, regardless of depth (ie: anything drawn in the Draw GUI event will <i>always</i> be drawn over anything drawn in the 
normal draw event, regardless of depth). The image below illustrates the order in which each event is performed:

<h3 class="studio">The Standard Draw Event</h3>
<p>
The normal Draw Events fall into three types: The <b>Draw begin</b>, the standard <b>Draw</b> and the <b>Draw End</b> events. In general, you will only need to use the standard <b>Draw</b> event and 
you should be aware that <i>all</i> instances in a room will have this standard draw event triggered each step of the game. So, this event will <i>always</i> be called as long as the instance has the 
<i>visible</i> flag set to true. Even if you have defined <i>nothing</i> for this event in the object properties (ie: no code nor actions), if the object has a sprite assigned it will still have a draw event which will be 
triggered! You see, <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> has two ways to draw things in the standard <b>Draw</b> event:
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>the default draw</b>, which is when you define the sprite in the object properties and place no actions or code in the normal draw event, in which case <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will draw that sprite, 
		but note that any transforms you perform in other events to change the image scale, index, blending etc... will be reflected too as long as the draw event is empty.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<li><b>the custom draw</b>, which is when you place code or actions in the draw event. This is telling <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> "I want to control what you draw for instances of this object" and it 
		completely over-rides the default draw. This means that you can have an object with a sprite assigned, then set the draw event to draw text and the sprite <i>will not be drawn</i> as you have not told 
		<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to draw it.
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Draw Begin and Draw End Events</h3>
<p>
Apart from the main draw Event, you also have a <b>Draw Begin</b> and a <b>Draw End</b> event. These act exactly the same as a standard Draw event (ie: they will draw whatever you put in them every 
step of the game and for all views), but they do not "default draw" anything if not added to an instance, and they will always run before/after the standard Draw event. So, you would have the <b>Draw Begin</b> 
step for <i>all</i> instances, then the Draw Event for all instances, then finally the <b>Draw End</b> step for all instances.
<br>
<br>

In this way, you can draw things or set draw properties in the Draw Begin step in one instance and be sure that all instances with a standard Draw event or Draw End event will use these properties or draw over 
what the first instance has drawn. Basically its a sure fire way to guarantee that certain things are drawn at certain times, much like the <b>Begin Step</b> and </b>End Step</b> events do.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Things to Note</h3>
<p>
There are a few things to note when drawing things in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, whether it's a sprite you are drawing or a shader, or 3D:

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>The draw event is a very intensive event, in that it's one of the events that takes up most time and resources... to that end it is <i>never</i> a good idea to do anything in the draw event other than 
		drawing. So save your large code or complex actions for the Step event or Alarms or whatever other event fits, but leave the draw event clear for the drawing as that's what it does best.</li>
		<br>
		
		<li>If your object has had the <b>visible</b> parameter set to off (so that the instances of the object are not drawn) then <b>all</b> draw events are skipped (except for the <b>Resize</b> event. This 
		means that making an instance invisible will stop all code placed in any of these events not to run, so don't put essential code in the draw events if they are not going to be visible.</li>
		<br>
		
		<li>What you draw has nothing to do with the collision engine you choose (traditional or physics) as that is defined by the object properties and the sprite or mask that the object has been given.</li>
	</ol>
