<h1 class="studio">Obsolete Functions</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section lists all the functions made obsolete in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> from previous versions of <i>GameMaker</i>.</h2>

 <p>
Due to the fact that <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> is focused on fast cross platform development, there are a number of functions that were available in previous versions of <i>GameMaker</i> that are now no longer 
supported. Most of these have been removed to permit games to run on devices without them blocking, but some have been removed because they are obsolete with current technology, or because they are specific 
functions for Windows that are no longer necessary.
<br>
<br>

Explaining exactly why each of these features was removed, as well as suggesting any possible workaround for you, is outside of the scope of this manual, but you can find a list of all the functions and functionality 
that has changed between Legacy versions and <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> here: <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/24909988-porting-gm7-and-gm8-games-to-gamemaker-studio" target="_blank">
YoYo Games Knowledge Base - Porting GM7 And GM8 Games To GameMaker: Studio</a>.
<br>
