<h2 class="studio">Add purchase details of a single product to a ds_map.</h2>

<p class="code">iap_purchase_details(product_id, ds_map);</p>
  
<p>

</p>
  
<div class="param">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>

		<tr><td>product_id</td>
		<td>The product ID string for the purchase.</td></tr>

		<tr class="alt"><td>ds_map</td>
		<td>The ds_map that will store the purchase information.</td></tr>

<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
With this function you can populate a previously created <a href="../data%20structures/ds%20maps/index.html"><tt>ds_map</tt></a> with a number of key/value pairs that describe the purchase details of 
the given product. The following data is returned within the map:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>"<b>product</b>" - The product ID string.<br><br>
		<li>"<b>order</b>" - The unique order ID, where available (not all stores support this).<br><br>
		<li>"<b>token</b>" - The purchase token string, where available (not all stores support this).<br><br>
		<li>"<b>payload</b>" - The payload returned by the target store, where available (not all purchases require this, and not all stores support this).<br><br>
		<li>"<b>receipt</b>" - The receipt string, where available (not all stores support this).<br><br>
		<li>"<b>response</b>" - A response value (as a real number), where available, based on the response values from Google Play 
		(see <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference.html">here</a> for details).
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
The map will also contain one further key, "<b>status</b>", which can be use to check the current status of the purchase. This key will have one of the following constants as it's value:
<br>
<br>

<div class="compat">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		
		<tr><td>iap_available</td><td>Product is available or the game is waiting for the result of a purchase.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>iap_failed</td><td>The purchase attempt failed.</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>iap_purchased</td><td>The product was successfully purchased.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>iap_canceled</td><td>The user cancelled the purchase.</td></tr>

		<tr><td>iap_refunded</td><td>The purchase has been rescinded.</td></tr>
		
	</table>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<br>

The following notes are related to the "token" and "receipt" keys of the map returned in reference to the target store being used:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>For the <b>Amazon Store</b> the purchase "token" and "receipt" entries are treated as one and the same.<br><br>

		<li>For <b>Google Play</b> there is no "receipt" data and you are expected to verify purchases via the returned "payload" (should you be verifying via a payload it is recommended that you do not use hard 
		coded values). gameMaker: Studio will still verify the data signature returned with a purchase by Google Play against the public key provided in the <b>IAP</b> tab of the <b>Global Game Settings</b>.<br><br>
		
		<li>For <b>Google Play</b> the "token" provided with a purchase is intended for use with consuming purchases.<br><br>

		<li>For <b>iOS</b> and <b>MacOSX</b> target stores there is "receipt" data available for purchases but the associated "token" is generated 
		<i>internally</i> for developer purposes.
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>The <tt>ds_map</tt> used is <b>not</b> created by the function, meaning that you must create it previously and remove it again from memory when not in use using the appropriate 
function.</i>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
var p_map = ds_map_create();<br>
var p_index = ds_map_find_value(iap_data, "index");<br>
iap_purchase_details(p_index, p_map);<br>
if ds_map_find_value(p_map, "status") == iap_purchased<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global.Gold += 100000;<br>       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
ds_map_destroy(p_map);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will create a ds_map and then populate it with the key/value pairs for the purchase with the product ID stored in the variable "p_index", which we get from the special <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map which 
is created exclusively in the <b>IAP Event</b>. If the "status" key returns the constant <tt>iap_purchased</tt>, it will then set a global variable.
