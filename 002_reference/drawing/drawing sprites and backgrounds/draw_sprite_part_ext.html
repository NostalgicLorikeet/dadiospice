<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
This function will draw a part of the chosen sprite at the given position following the same rules as per <a href="draw_sprite_part.html"><tt>draw_sprite_part</tt></a>, only now you can scale the part, 
blend a colour with it, or change its alpha when drawing it to the screen (the same as when drawing a sprite with <a href="draw_sprite_ext.html"><tt>draw_sprite_ext</tt></a>). You should note that 
if the texture page permits automatic cropping then this function may not work as expected, since the extra "empty" space around the sprite will have been removed for creating the texture page. To resolve 
this issue, you will need to set the texture page settings (in the Global Game Settings) to <b>no cropping</b>.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>When drawing with this function, the sprite <a href="../../objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/sprite_xoffset.html">x offset</a> and 
<a href="../../objects%20and%20instances/instances/instance%20properties/sprite_yoffset.html">y offset</a> are ignored and the sprite part will be drawn with the top left corner at the specified x / y 
position in the room.</i>
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>Colour blending is only recommended for the HTML5 target when WebGL is enabled, although you can still set the blending colour if it is not enabled and it will blend the sprite as normal. However 
all blending in this way creates a duplicate sprite which is then stored in the cache and used when required. This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance 
unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function 
<a href="../../game%20assets/sprites/sprite_set_cache_size.html"><tt>sprite_set_cache_size</tt></a>.</i>
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>This function is only useful for <b>bitmap</b> sprites and will not work with SWF or JSON (Spine) sprites.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
draw_sprite_part_ext(sprite_index, image_index, 8, 8, sprite_width-16, sprite_height-16, x, y, 2, 0.5, c_black, 1);
</p>
<p>
This will draw the instances assigned sprite (sprite_index) and its current frame of animation (image_index), however it will shave an 8px margin off all four sides of the sprite. It will then be stretched to double its 
usual width but half its usual height, and although the alpha is still 1, it will be blended with black (turning it into a silhouette).
