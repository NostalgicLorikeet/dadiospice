<h1 class="studio">In App Purchases</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with setting up in app purchases for your game.</h2>

<p>
In App Purchases are an important part of modern, cross platform games, permitting you to have "freemium" content where your game is free, but certain content is only available through a purchase from within 
the game itself. For example, your puzzle game is free, but the extra levels are going to cost the user 0.99$. This app model is very common and can be set up with a minimum amount of work from within 
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, and this section of the manual has details of all the available functions that enable you to do just that, as well as some advice for setting up and information on how to test on the 
different platforms.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>This functionality is limited to the <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">Professional Version</a> of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, and only those versions that have the Mac, iOS, 
or Android target modules. For Android you will have to have downloaded and installed the Google Play Services extension along with the Google Play In App Purchases extension from the YoYo Games Marketplace. Once you have added the extensions to the project you can go to the <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/Android%20Tab.html">Android Global Game options</a> and select the <b>Social</b> tab, then check the appropriate check-boxes.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Setting up in app purchases within your game is relatively simple with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>, but it still requires some amount of knowledge of the target platform setup as well as careful planning before 
starting to create your game, so it is not recommended that you use this functionality if you are just starting with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> or if you are not sure how the different stores for each target platform 
are set up.
<br>
<br>

Before doing anything else you will have to make sure that in app purchases are enabled in the <b>Global Game Settings</b> before they will be functional in your game (more information can be found on the 
page <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/In%20App%20Purchases%20Tab.html">Global Game Settings - In App Purchases Tab</a>). You will also need to have set up the purchase details on the target 
store for each platform that you wish to support, taking careful note of each of the <b>Product IDs</b> that you define, as these ID strings are how GameMaker: Studio identifies each product and purchase.
<br>
<br>

<p>
To help those of you that have never worked with any type if IAP services and to explain the different ways that IAP can be tested on different devices, please see the following pages:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/29734673.html" target="_blank">IAP Example</a><br> 
		<li><a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/29736883" target="_blank">IAP Testing</a><br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>GameMaker: Studio currently permits up to 128 purchases per title, except if you are using the Amazon Store (for Android) where it is limited to 100.</i>
<br>
<br>

<i><b>WARNING: </b>You will not be able to make purchases when debugging titles using the GameMaker IDE. Instead you will need to create final executables to ensure the title can correctly communicate 
with the respective store servers.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">GameMaker: Studio Functions</h3>
<p>
Below are listed the functions that are integrated in <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to enable in app purchases on iOS and Android target devices (this is the ability to buy extra credits, items, levels and other 
things from within the game itself). Many of these functions will trigger an asynchronous <a href="../../001_advanced%20use/more%20about%20async%20events/iap.html"><b>IAP Event</b></a>, which contains 
a special <tt>ds_map</tt> with an initial key "type". This can then be queried to get the type of IAP event that has been triggered, which will then permit you to get further data from the map.
<br>
<br>

The available in app purchase functions are:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="iap_activate.html">iap_activate</a><br> 
		<li><a href="iap_status.html">iap_status</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_enumerate_products.html">iap_enumerate_products</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_restore_all.html">iap_restore_all</a><br>		
		<li><a href="iap_acquire.html">iap_acquire</a><br> 
		<li><a href="iap_consume.html">iap_consume</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_product_details.html">iap_product_details</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_purchase_details.html">iap_purchase_details</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_is_purchased.html">iap_is_purchased</a><br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
You should also be aware that GameMaker: Studio does <i><b>not</b></i> persist active purchase state across multiple plays of the game (and thus <tt>iap_is_purchased()</tt> is unreliable if a store has 
not successfully loaded). This means that you will have to store this information yourself and retrieve it again on each start-up of your game. You can use the special "secure" save and load functions provided for 
ds_maps for this purpose:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="../Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/ds_map_secure_save.html">ds_map_secure_save</a><br> 
		<li><a href="../Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/ds_map_secure_load.html">ds_map_secure_load</a><br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p> 
GameMaker: Studio does not persist purchase state across multiple plays of the game because it is not appropriate for us to provide a secure method of verifying whether or not an individual purchase is valid and 
therefore any automatically stored purchase state would be presumptuous. On most platforms "receipt" data will be available through <a href="iap_purchase_details.html"><tt>iap_purchase_details()</tt></a> 
which users can use to verify a purchase, although Google Play uses "token" data instead.
<br>
<br> 

GameMaker: Studio requires the <b>Google Play Public Key</b> for simple local purchase verification and you may check that the "payload" data returned with a purchase result matches that used with the matching 
call to <tt>iap_acquire()</tt>.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Deprecated Functions</h3>
<p>
With the update to version 1.3, the In App Purchasing routines were made more secure and also simplified somewhat, meaning that some functions have been made obsolete and will no longer do anything. These 
functions are listed below <i>for reference only</i> and should <b>not</b> be used. Any games created with these that you wish to update on a store will need to be re-written using the newer system.
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="iap_store_status.html">iap_store_status</a><br> 
		<li><a href="iap_event_queue.html">iap_event_queue</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_product_status.html">iap_product_status</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_is_downloaded.html">iap_is_downloaded</a><br> 		
		<li><a href="iap_product_files.html">iap_product_files</a><br>
		<li><a href="iap_files_purchased.html">iap_files_purchased</a><br>
	</ol>
