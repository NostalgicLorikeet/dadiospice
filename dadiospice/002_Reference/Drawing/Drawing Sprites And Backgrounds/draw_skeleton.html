<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
This function is <i>only</i> for use with sprites that have been created using a skeletal animation program like Spine. While you can draw these sprites using the normal draw functions (like 
<a href="draw_self.html"><tt>draw_self()</tt></a>), there are times when you may want to draw a single frame or show a change of skin texture without actually changing the sprite properties. 
In these cases you can draw the sprite with this function, where you give the sprite index and then the name of the animation to get the frame from (a string, as set within the program used to 
make the sprite). Next you give the name of the skin to use (again, as set when the sprite was made), and a frame value. The frame value is for telling <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> what part of the 
animation to show and is a value between 0 and the <a href="../../Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/image_number.html"><tt>image_number</tt></a>. The rest of the arguments 
are the same as those used for normal sprite drawing and will change the scale, angle, blend colour and alpha of the final animation frame being drawn.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>WARNING!</b> Because of the way skeletal animations are interpolated between various "key" frames, there is an additional overhead associated with this call and therefore it is recommended that 
you avoid drawing skeleton based sprites using this method unless absolutely necessary.</i>
<blockquote>
<i><b>IMPORTANT: </b>Spine integration in GameMaker: Studio is a Pro licence feature and will not work in the Free/Standard versions.</i>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
draw_skeleton(spr_Jump, "jump", "skin1", 0, x, y, image_xscale, image_yscale, image_angle, c_white, 0.5);
</p>
<p>
The above code will draw the first frame of the given skeletal animation sprite, using the "jump" animation set, the skin defined as "skin1" and at the same scale and position as the instance properties define, but with 
an alpha of 0.5.
