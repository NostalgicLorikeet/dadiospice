<h1 class="studio">audio_create_play_queue</h1>

<h2 class="studio">Create a queue of audio from a buffer for streaming.</h2>

<h3 class="studio">Syntax:</h3>
<p class="code">audio_create_play_queue(queueFormat, queueRate, queueChannels);</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>queueFormat</td>
	<td>The format of the buffer data to use (<tt>buffer_u8</tt> or <tt>buffer_s16</tt>).</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>queueRate</td>
	<td>The sample rate of the data in the buffer queue.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>queueChannels</td>
	<td>The channels to use from one of the constants listed below.</td></tr>
	
</table>
</div>
<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns: </b>Index

<h3 class="studio">Description</h3>
<p>
This function prepares a buffer queue for audio. You pass data format (only <tt>buffer_u8</tt> or <tt>buffer_s16</tt> are currently supported), the sample rate (which can be between 1000hz and 48000hz), 
and the channels that the audio requires from one of the constants listed 
below:
<div class="compat">
	<table>
	
		<tr><th>Constant</th>						<th>Description</th></tr>
		
		<tr><td>audio_mono</td>					<td>Mono (single channel) audio.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>audio_stereo</td>	<td>Stereo (dual channel) audio.</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>audio_3D</td>						<td>3D (5.1) audio.</td></tr>
		
	</table>
</div>

<p>
<br>
Note that you should free up any audio queues created with this function when no longer required to prevent memory leaks using the function <a href="audio_free_play_queue.html"><tt>audio_free_play_queue()</tt></a>.
<br>
<br>
This function will trigger an <a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20About%20Async%20Events/Audio%20Playback.html">Audio Playback Asynchronous Event</a> when the queue has reached the end, and in this event 
a special <tt>ds_map</tt> will be created in the variable <tt>async_load</tt> with the following key/value pairs:

	<ul>
		<li>"queue_id" - the queue that has finished playing data
		
		<li>"buffer_id" - the buffer that is no longer being played from
		
		<li>"queue_shutdown" - this is set to 0 during normal playback and 1 when the event is received because <a href="audio_free_play_queue.html"><tt>audio_free_play_queue</tt></a> has been called. When this 
		is set to 1, you don't want to queue up any further data.
		
	</ul>
	
	
<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
audio_queue = audio_create_play_queue(buffer_s16, 11052, audio_mono);
</p>
<p>
The above code creates a new audio queue and assigns its index to a variable for future reference.
