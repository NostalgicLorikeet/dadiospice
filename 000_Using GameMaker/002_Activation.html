<h1 class="studio">Activating GameMaker: Studio</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> requires an internet connection to activate your licence before you can use it.</h2>

<p>
Once you have installed your version of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> you will be shown the following Welcome Screen:

<img class="center" src="../Images/licensescreen.png">

From here you have three options:
<ul>
	<li><b>GameMaker Studio 2 Trial</b> - Here you can find a link to downloading GameMaker Studio 2 and setting yourself up a free trial (if your YoYo Account isn't already set up for this)<br><br>
	
	<li><b>YoYo Account</b> - If you have already set up your <b>YYA</b> (YoYo Account) then you can enter your <i>Email</i> and <i>Password</i> to licence GameMaker: Studio and start making games. 
	Note that if you have a <b>GameMaker: Marketplace</b> account, then you can use the email/password that you set up for them here too.<br><br>
	
	<li><b>Studio Licence</b> - If you have an existing GameMaker: Studio licence and do not currently wish to register for a <b>YYA</b> (YoYo Account), then you can input your existing licence here.
</ul>

<p>
After licensing you will be prompted to restart GameMaker: Studio. If your licence has any extra modules attached to it, you may be prompted to download additional files and then restart again before you can access 
them.
<br>
<br>

<h4 class="studio">Important</h4>
<p>
While <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> itself does not require an internet connection to be used, it will require occasional access to maintain the license activated. If there is no internet connection when requested, your copy of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will not work except as the "free" version until such time as this is resolved.
</p>

<h3 class="studio">Additional Modules</h3>
<p>

<b>GameMaker: Studio 1.4 is no longer available for sale and as such you can not add extra modules onto your licence now. If you would like to purchase new platforms you would need to get GameMaker Studio 2 (which is a separate product and your current license would not carry over).</b>
