<h1 class="studio">Editing Subimages</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> has a built-in image editor that can be used to edit individual sub-images of sprites and background images. </h2>

<p>
To aid you in your task of creating a good game, <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> provides you with its own editor for editing backgrounds and sprites. Both resources share the same editor so although this page refers to sprites, 
the exact same commands are available for backgrounds too. To call the editor for a sub-image of a sprite, select the sub-image in the sprite editor and choose <b>Edit Image</b> from the <b>Image</b> menu (or double 
click on it, or press the "Edit Image" button on the toolbar), and to edit a background, open the background properties window and press the button labelled <b>Edit Background</b>.
<br>
<br>
The built-in editor is primarily meant for making changes to images, not for creating sprites and backgrounds from scratch, as, although the built-in image editor is pretty powerful, it does not have all the features of full-blown 
paint and drawing package. It is great for roughing out some place-holder images but for brand new sprites and graphics you probably want to use a separate paint program, save the images as PNG files, and then load them 
into <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> for further work. Note that you can also set an external image editor in the <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/Preferences/index.html"> Preferences</a> and so bypass this section all together.

<p>
When you start the image editor it will typically looks as follows:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../../Images/form_image_editor.png">

<p>
As you can see, the image to be edited takes up the space in the middle of the screen with the editing tools and menus arrayed around it. At the bottom of the screen is the Infobar where you can get basic information 
about the state of the editor, with the current mouse x/y position and the percentage of zoom being applied shown at all times. It will also show the x/y coordinates of any selection along with the maximal width and 
height of the selection.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Menus</h3>
<p>
The drop down menus at the top of the screen are almost exactly the same as those found in the <a href="Editing%20Sprites.html">Sprite Editor</a>, particularly the 
<a href="Edit%20Menus/Edit%20Menu.html">Edit Menu</a>, the <a href="Edit%20Menus/Transform%20Menu.html">Transform Menu</a>, and the <a href="Edit%20Menus/Images%20Menu.html">Image Menu</a>. The File Menu is similar too, 
but has a few less options and they work in different ways:
<br>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>New: </b>Creates a new image. This basically wipes the current sub-image ready for you to start from scratch, but it does not change the size.<br></li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Save as PNG file: </b>Saves the current image as a one frame *.png file.<br></li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Previous Image, Next image: </b>Switches sub-images either one frame to the left, or one frame to the right. In this way you can edit multiple sub-images, one after another. <i>Note:</i> This will effectively 
	save any changes to the current sub-image, so use with care as you get no prompt.<br></li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Close saving changes: </b>As it says, this will close the editor and save any changes to the current image.<br></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
You also have a <a href="Edit%20Menus/View%20Menu.html">View Menu</a> for controlling how the image being created is shown in the editor.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Toolbar</h3>
<p>
Like the drop down menus, the toolbar features a number of commands that are covered in the section dealing with the <a href="Editing%20Sprites.html">Sprite Editor</a>, however there are a couple of new ones at the 
end which we will cover here:
<br>
<blockquote>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="Zoom_In.png"></div><br>
	<b>Zoom In</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Zoom the image in the editor to see better the individual pixels. The mouse wheel can also be used for zoom too.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="Zoom_Actual.png"></div><br>
	<b>Zoom Reset</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This resets the zoom to a 1x1 ratio.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="Zoom_Out.png"></div><br>
	<b>Zoom In</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Zoom the image in the editor out to see better the overall image. The mouse wheel can also be used for zoom too.
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="Grid.png"></div><br>
	<b>Toggle Pixel Grid</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can click this to toggle the pixel grid on or off (the grid is only visible when you zoom in).
	<br>
	<br>
<div style="float:left">
<img src="Preview.png"></div><br>
	<b>Zoom In</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This will toggle on and off the preview panel (situated below the colour tools) so you can see the image at actual size even when zoomed in or out.
	<br>
	<br>
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3 class="studio">Drawing Tools</h3>
<p>
The drawing tools permit you to select different brush sizes, select regions, draw forms, etc... You can use them by left clicking on one and then left clicking in the image being edited. The full list of available 
draw tools can be found from the following page:

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="Drawing%20Tools.html">Drawing Tools</a>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Colour And Blending Tools</h3>
<p>
The right hand side of the window is mostly taken up with the colour tools. These are simple to use, yet give you great control over the colours that you can draw with. At the top you have the section labelled <b>colours</b> with 
two boxes labelled "Left" and "Right" which set the colour for the corresponding mouse buttons (these boxes also set the colours for certain drawing tools, which we cover in the <b>Drawing Tools</b> section below. 
Beneath that you have a basic colour picker which covers a very limited range of the most used colours, while beneath that you can find a more advanced colour picker for fine-tuning your choice. The <b>Opacity</b> setting controls the 
transparency of what is being drawn, with 255 being fully opaque and 0 being fully transparent, while the last control, <b>colour Mode</b>, tells <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to draw and blend the alpha channel, or to overwrite it 
using the current alpha.
<br>
<br>

Note that you can also create custom colour pallets, see the section on <a href="Advanced%20Tools.html">Advanced Drawing Tools</a>.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Image Preview</h3>
<p>
The <i>Image Preview</i> shows you an image of the sprite as it would appear in the game. If you double click on it, you can switch between x1, x2 and x3 scaling, giving you a much clearer picture of the 
sprite and how it looks while editing it in the main window. Note that you may need to expand the sprite editor window to see this. The preview window can be enabled or disabled from the 
<a href="Edit%20Menus/View%20Menu.html">View Menu</a>.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Onion-Skinning</h3>
<p>

At the bottom right of the window you can see the controls for the <i>Onion-Skinning</i> function of the image editor. What onion-skinning means is that in a single frame of any sprite animation, you can choose 
to see any of the preceding or succeeding four frames as a semi-transparent layer under the image frame you are currently working on.
<br>
<br>

You can choose the alpha value that each frame will be drawn with, from 0 to 255, as well as how many of the frames to show. By setting the <i>Forward</i> value you can see those frames that come after the frame 
currently being edited and by setting the <i>Backwards</i> value, you can see those that come before. You can set these to a value from 0 (none) to 4 (all four frames will be drawn), permitting you a far greater 
control over animations and positioning than was previously possible.
<br>
<br>

Note that we suggest using the onion-skinning over a colour-fill background rather than a transparent one (you can set this option from the <b>View</b> menu of the image editor and selecting <i>Set Transparency 
Background</i>), as it makes the transparencies of the various skins easier to see.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">Advanced Drawing Tools</h3>
<p>
Apart from those tools listed above, there are also a number of advanced options available to you when working with the Image Editor. You can find more about these options from the following page:

<blockquote>
