<h1 class="studio">More About Async Events</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This is the event that will be triggered by any call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
An asynchronous event is one that is fired off when <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> receives a "call back" from some external source, which can be from the web or from the device running your game. Basically, you tell 
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> to do something, like load an image, and it'll start to do this but continue doing whatever it else it has to do meanwhile its working. Then, when the request has been completed, a 
call-back will be sent to <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> and any Asynchronous Events defined for that type of call back will be fired. Please note that the Asynchronous Events are fired for all instances that have them, 
much like the key events, so you can do an <tt>http_get</tt> call in one instance, yet have the Asynchronous HTTP event in another.
