<h1 class="studio">IAP Event</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This is the sub event that will be triggered by any IAP call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
This event can only be triggered when you have activated <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/index.html">In App Purchases</a> for your game. If you have this functionality added, then the event 
will be triggered under the following circumstances:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>The store state changes.
		<li>A product (or products) have been activated.
		<li>The product and purchases have been restored.
		<li>A product has been purchased.
		<li>A product has been consumed.
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
The event will always create a special <a href="../../002_Reference/Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"><tt>ds_map</tt></a> with an index ID stored in the built in variable <tt><b>iap_data</b></tt>. 
This map will <i>always</i> contain the key "<b>type</b>", which will hold one of the following constant values:
<br>
<br>

<div class="compat">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		
		<tr><td>iap_ev_storeload</td><td>This is triggered when a change is detected in the target platform store.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>iap_ev_product</td><td>This event is triggered when a product is activated and will contain additional information about the product.</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>iap_ev_restore</td><td>This event is only triggered when you use the <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_restore_all.html"><tt>iap_restore_all</tt></a> function.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>iap_ev_purchase</td><td>When a purchase has been completed, this event is triggered.</td></tr>

		<tr><td>iap_ev_consume</td><td>When you use the function <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_consume.html"><tt>iap_consume</tt></a> it triggers this event.</td></tr>
		
	</table>
</div>

<p>
<br>
<br>
Each of these possible event "types" will add extra keys to the <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map, which can then be parsed to get the purchase or product information necessary. The exact contents of the <tt>iap_data</tt> 
map are listed below for each event "type".
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">iap_ev_storeload</h3>
<p>
When you activate your purchases, your game will try to contact the target store, triggering this event in the process. The <tt>iap_data</tt> map will then have an addition key "<b>status"</b>, which will have 
one of the following constants as it's value:
<br>
<br>

<div class="compat">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		
		<tr><td>iap_storeload_ok</td><td>The store has been contacted and the connection is good.</td></tr>
		
		<tr class="alt"><td>iap_storeload_failed</td><td>There has been a connection error or for some reason the store is unavailable.</td></tr>

	</table>
</div>
<p>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">iap_ev_product</h3>
<p>
All activated purchases will trigger this event "type", but only once per purchase, so if you have activated ten products you should expect this event to trigger ten times. If you have received this event, 
the <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map will hold the additional key "<b>index</b>" which holds the unique <b>product ID string</b> for the product being activated. You can then use the function 
<a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_product_details.html"><tt>iap_product_details</tt></a> along with this product ID to get further information.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b> Google Play (Android) can only request details for products 20 at a time which can lead to quite long load times for applications with a significant number of products.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">iap_ev_restore</h3>
<p>
When you call the function <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_restore_all.html"><tt>iap_restore_all</tt></a> it will trigger this event, adding a "<b>result</b>" key to the <tt>iap_data</tt> 
ds_map. This key will hold either <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> to indicate whether the purchase data has been successfully restored from the target store.
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">iap_ev_purchase</h3>
<p>
On requesting a purchase using the function <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_acquire.html"><tt>iap_acquire</tt></a> this event type will be triggered. The <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map will 
have the additional key "<b>index</b>" which holds the unique <b>purchase ID</b> value for the product being purchased. You can then use the function 
<a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_purchase_details.html"><tt>iap_purchase_details</tt></a> along with this purchase ID to get further information.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b> If the product purchased is consumable then it <b>must be used</b> using <tt>iap_consume</tt> before a further purchase can be made.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="studio">iap_ev_consume</h3>
<p>
When using the function <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_consume.html"><tt>iap_consume</tt></a> this event type will be triggered. The <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map will 
have the additional key "<b>product</b>" which holds the unique <b>product ID</b> string for the product being consumed. 
<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>The <tt>iap_data</tt> ds_map created for the in app purchase event is <b>only valid in this event</b> and should not be accessed anywhere else in your game.</i>
